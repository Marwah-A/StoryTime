# Story-Time
This app provides short stories with moral lessons for kids in a fun way!


## Phases of developing this app:

### 1. The Idea:
I looked for an idea that is simple and suitable for my level of knowledge and experience,
but at the same time I wanted it to be useful and meaningful. So I came up with "Story Time App"
This app should have:
- short-type stories
- images to drag kids attention
- lets the kid choose and navigate between the stories
- displays the moral lessons in an interactive manner
- mentions the copyrights of the stories, images and my work
    
### 2. Preparing The Initial Design of Interfaces:  
a sketch for how the app will look like includes:
- layout
- what views
- size of views
- position of views
- constraints needed
      
### 3. Gathering Resources: 
searching for stories, images and icons
    
### 4. Designing Interfaces: 
puting together all components that will be shown on the screen
    
### 5. Linking Views: 
creating the navigation between screens
    
### 6. Testing Interfaces: 
making sure everything looks as it should look, and testing the navigation
    
### 7. Preparing Information: 
creating the swift file that holds the information for each story
    
### 8. Adding Functionality: 
here is the coding part, and it has four main tasks:
- passing the kid's name to next screen
- passing the number that represents the kid's choice of the story
- displaying the desired story with its image and texts
- displying the moral lesson of story only when the kid click the button
      
### 9. Testing Functionality: 
making sure the app does what it should do
    
### 10. Uploading on GitHub


## Future Development

There are many features that I would like to add to Story Time:
- More stories
- Book style
  - Change the displaying style to be like flipping book pages
- More Pictures
- Add sound effects
- Long or short story
    - let the kid choose to read long or short story
